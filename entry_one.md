# Entry One:

This entry allows me to test making .md files then pushing changes to my GitHub repository.

The steps to do so are:

- cd LIS624_VanName (changing directory to our repository)
- tilde entry_x.md (selecting our text editor and naming our file, filling in the x)
- write, save, and exit from the file and text editor

- git add entry_x.md
- git commit -m "commit message here"
- git push origin main
- git status (check this to make sure everything is in one branch! anything that is "ahead" needs to be pushed)

# Note to self: Don't edit anything using the online interface. If you do:

Steps:
 - cd LIS624_VanName
 - git pull origin main (If the system warns about divergent branches, merge!)
 - git status
