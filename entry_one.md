Entry One:

This entry allows me to test making .md files then pushing changes to my GitHub repository.

The steps to do so are:

cd LIS624_VanName (changing directory to our repository)
tilde entry_x.md (selecting our text editor and naming our file, filling in the x)
write, save, and exit from the file and text editor

git add entry_x.md
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push origin main
